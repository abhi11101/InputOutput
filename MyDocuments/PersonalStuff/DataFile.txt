In Java, byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. All byte stream classes are descended from InputStream and OutputStream. These abstract classes define methods for reading and writing bytes, but they are not directly instantiated. Instead, their concrete subclasses like FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, BufferedInputStream, and BufferedOutputStream are used.
